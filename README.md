Socani is a free and open source fresh take on the classic [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) game. 

## Create custom maps
All maps in Socani are made using the map editor [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) and are imported with a custom parser at [Level.cs](https://github.com/Entalpi/Socani/blob/master/Assets/Resources/scripts/Level.cs). Tile properties are supported and can be more or less painfree which is nice. :)

All the levels and the tileset is located in the folder [Resources/levels](https://github.com/Entalpi/Socani/tree/master/Assets/Resources/levels). Simply import the tileset and in to Tiled load a level and modify! Go nuts! ðŸ¥œ

## Changes from Sokoban
- Can move multiple crates ðŸ“¦
- Multiple crate color with their own goals ðŸ¥…
- Coins ðŸ’°
- Rewind mechanic as a gameplay mechanic ðŸ•“

## Documentation
In general the source code and comments should be enough. [Here](https://lingtorp.com/2019/04/13/Tile-based-level-representation-in-Unity.html) is a blog post about Socani old level representation for some perspective. ðŸŒž
